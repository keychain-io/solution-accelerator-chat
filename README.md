# Keychain Chat Samples
This repository contains sample Chat applications using Android, iOS, and C# .NET. Two or more devices may pair with each other using QR Codes and MQTT. Thereafter they can send end-to-end encrypted and digitally signed messages to each other.

Each sample is located in a corresponding subdirectory of this repository. Please see the README.md files in each project for specific instructions on how to configure, run and use each sample.
